<h1> Wildfires Analysis in the US </h1>

<h2> Overview </h2>

An interactive dashboard of wildfires that occured in the United States from 2000-2020. We used PostgreSQL, Flask, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Leaflet, Plotly, and Highcharts to analyze and visualize our findings to the following questions:

* What are the Primary Factors Contributing to these Fires?
* Does a relationship exist between the passage of time and the total count of large wildfires?
* Top 10 states with the most fires? Top ten with the least?
* Which states had the most acres burned? Which states had the least?



Team members: Emily Boulware, Jair Navarrete, Shelby Reyes-Widrick, and Desmond Workman

<h2> Data Sources </h2>

The dataset used was from kaggle and can be found [here.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/behroozsohrabi/us-wildfire-records-6th-edition 'US Wildfires') 
The wildfire records were acquired from several reporting systems of federal, state, and local fire organizations.
